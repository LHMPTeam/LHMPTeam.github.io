<h3>About</h3>

<p><strong>Welcome to the official website of Lost Heaven Multiplayer.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Mr. Salieri sends his regards.&rdquo;</em> - Vito Scaletta</p></blockquote>

<p>Lost Heaven Multiplayer (LHMP) was a fan-made modification of legendary video game <em>Mafia:The City of Lost Heaven</em>, produced by <em>Illusion Software</em> (today <em>2K Czech</em>) and released in 2002. The aim of modification was to enhance the original game with multiplayer expecience, similar to other popular multiplayer modifications such as <a href="http://sa-mp.com">SA-MP</a>.</p>

<p>The project initialy started in August 2013 as a hobby attempt of 3 young boys from Slovakia and ended in Summer 2015. The reason was a lack of time due. As for today, <strong>project is no longer officialy supported</strong>, and neither technical, nor mentor support is provided by the original team.</p>

<p>This page has been set up in order to preserve our story and to provide a guide to eager Mafia players that would like to at least try it on their own.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>

<p>The project was programmed in <em>C++</em> with chunks of <em>inline Assembler</em>. Due to lack of software engineering skills and experience (that time we were 18-, 16- and 15-years old),  the created code resulted in a messy composition of classes connected using a single Singleton. Therefore, there is no ambition to continue the currect project with completely rewriting it from the scratch.</p>
